              <p>I'm a product manager located in Portland, OR. I recently went through an acquisition with my former start-up company, Thunder Industries, and now I work at Walmart Connect. </p>
              <p>In the day time, I operate as a PM. I own the vision and execution of the creative editor, a cloud based design tool that allows anyone to build and scale ads across channels.
              </p>
              <p> Off-hours, I spend my free time learning how to program. I love being able to individually contribute to an outcome and solve fun logic problems. Check out my portfolio to see what I've learned.
