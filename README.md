# portfolio-v2

This portfolio is intended to showcase my background, experience and my learning journey with Thinkful. In this second iteration of this portfolio project, I explore using flexboxes and a mobile first design approach. The user can resize the browser to view the layout changes from row to column as the size of the window decreases. 

The webpage is designed using html, css and integrated with a formspree email API. 

Thanks for reading!
